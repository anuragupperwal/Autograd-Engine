Custom Autograd Engine

Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a custom autograd engine, a fundamental tool for machine learning frameworks that automates the process of differentiation. Inspired by popular frameworks like PyTorch, this engine is built to be dynamic, modular, and educational, enabling forward and backward propagation for optimizing complex models.

Core Features

	1. Dynamic Computational Graph
Automatically constructs a graph during forward propagation and efficiently traverses it during backward propagation.
	2. Gradient Computation
Supports backpropagation through any chain of operations, ensuring accurate gradient propagation.
	3. Modular Design
Incorporates reusable components like linear layers, activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid), and optimizers (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent).
	4. Visualization Tools
Tracks and visualizes metrics such as training loss and gradient flow, assisting in debugging and performance evaluation.


Methodology

	â€¢ Core Data Structure: A Tensor class encapsulates data, gradients, and operations within a computational graph.
	â€¢ Automatic Differentiation: Each operation (e.g., addition, multiplication, matrix multiplication) is tracked in the computational graph, enabling recursive gradient computation via backpropagation.
	â€¢ Modular Components: Includes essential building blocks like:
	â€¢ Linear layers
	â€¢ Activation functions
	â€¢ Optimizers

This modular framework ensures that components can be reused, extended, and adapted for various machine learning tasks, making the engine not just efficient but also flexible and educational.

Comparison to Popular Frameworks Like PyTorch

While inspired by frameworks like PyTorch, this custom autograd engine is designed as a lightweight, educational alternative. It prioritizes simplicity and transparency, offering a hands-on approach to understanding how modern machine learning frameworks operate under the hood.

Key Comparisons

	1. Computational Graphs
	â€¢ PyTorch employs a dynamic computational graph with memory reuse and parallel computation.
	â€¢ This custom engine dynamically builds and traverses graphs but does not yet optimize memory reuse or parallel execution.
	2. Gradient Computation
	â€¢ PyTorch supports automatic differentiation for hundreds of predefined functions.
	â€¢ This custom engine focuses on core operations, emphasizing clarity and foundational principles.
	3. Extensibility
	â€¢ PyTorch allows seamless integration of custom layers, activation functions, and loss functions.
	â€¢ The custom engine demonstrates this extensibility on a smaller scale, letting users define forward and backward rules for custom components.
	4. Performance
	â€¢ PyTorch leverages GPU acceleration and optimized C++ backends for industrial-grade performance.
	â€¢ The custom engine is implemented purely in Python and NumPy, making it suitable for small-scale experiments and educational purposes.
