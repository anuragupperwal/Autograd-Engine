**Situation**

In machine learning, frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow automate differentiation and backpropagation, but their abstraction often hides the underlying mechanics. To deepen my understanding of gradient-based optimization and backpropagation, I undertook the task of designing and implementing a **custom Autograd Engine** from scratch.

**Task**

The objective was to create a modular and dynamic autograd engine capable of:

1.	**Dynamic Computational Graph Creation:** Recording operations during the forward pass.

2.	**Backpropagation:** Traversing the computational graph in reverse to compute gradients.

3.	**Gradient-Based Optimization:** Enabling parameter updates using optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

4.	**Visualization Tools:** Providing insights through metrics like training loss and gradient flow.

This required not only implementing the core functionality but also validating its correctness and benchmarking it against established frameworks like PyTorch.

**Action**

1.	**Tensor Implementation:**

•	Designed a Tensor class to encapsulate data, gradients, and operation history.

•	Integrated support for mathematical operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) that dynamically linked tensors in a computational graph.

2.	**Backpropagation Logic:**

•	Implemented a recursive backward() method that computed gradients using the chain rule.

•	Designed modular operations like Add, Mul, and MatMul, ensuring compatibility with the autograd system.

3.	**Optimization Framework:**

•	Developed an SGD optimizer to update model parameters based on computed gradients.

•	Added optional support for regularization to mitigate overfitting.

4.	**Results Visualization:**

•	Plotted training loss and gradient flow during training to validate the engine’s functionality.

•	Compared performance metrics (execution time and loss convergence) with PyTorch to identify areas for improvement.

**Result**

•	Successfully implemented a dynamic autograd engine capable of handling forward and backward passes for a simple neural network.

•	Visualized the **training loss** and **gradient flow**, confirming stable convergence and correct gradient propagation.

•	Benchmarked the custom engine against PyTorch:

•	Achieved comparable **loss convergence** despite a slight performance gap (execution time: 5.72 seconds vs. 3.38 seconds for PyTorch).

•	Enhanced my understanding of **backpropagation** and the mechanics of machine learning frameworks, providing a strong foundation for future projects.
